  This report summarizes web traffic across USGS Water Mission Area web applications using Google Analytics data. A summary across all applications
  and information on individual applications are available. Data are updated on a daily basis. 

disclaimerTitle: "Disclaimer"

disclaimer1: |
  Google analytics (GA) algorithms are subject to change without notice and these changes may impact apparent trends in usage. 
  
  GA cannot record visitors using certain ad blockers or other browser plugins.
  
  Web applications included in this report have used GA for varying periods of time; therefore retrospective analysis 
  may be limited by the GA history available for any given website or application.
  
  Web service calls (such as a user accessing data through the NWIS API) are not included in this report; only user visits 
  to websites are tracked.

disclaimer2: |  
  [Bot Filtering](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1010249?hl=en) is a function that removes traffic attributed 
  to automated crawlers (non-human users) from web traffic tracking and reporting. Until recently bot filtering was used 
  inconsistently across projects included in this report. Bots and spiders may artificially inflate the reported traffic 
  for a website, and decrease time on page; reported data from low traffic websites without bot filtering enabled should 
  be used with caution.

session: |
  [Session](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2731565?hl=en#sessions-and-new-users): 
  A GA session is a group of interactions that users make on a website within a given time frame.
  
visitors: |
  [Visitor, new and returning](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1257084?hl=en): 
  The initial session by a user during any given date range is considered to be an additional session 
  and an additional visitor (new visitor). Any future sessions from the same user during the selected 
  time period are counted as additional sessions, but not as additional visitors (returning visitor).
  Note that one person accessing a site on multiple devices or multiple browsers will count as multiple 
  visitors. Additionally, if a user has disabled or deletes cookies GA will not recognize them as the
  same visitor.
  
geographical: |
  [Geographical data](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6160484?hl=en): 
  Geographical data are obtained from IP-based locations and are approximate. 

average: |
  [Average time on page](http://help.analyticsedge.com/googleanalytics/misunderstood-metrics-time-on-page-session-duration/): 
  The average amount of time users spend on a website. This number can be biased by users who exit a website without navigating 
  to another page or otherwise interacting. This number should be interpreted with caution, especially for websites with relatively 
  low traffic. 

traffic: |
  [Traffic source / medium](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6099206?hl=en): 
  These two dimensions are combined into a single variable by GA. Source: the origin of your traffic, such as a search engine 
  (for example, google) or a domain (example.com). Medium: the general category of the source, for example, organic search (organic), 
  cost-per-click paid search (cpc), web referral (referral).
  
  Direct traffic sessions can originate from a wide range of sources that do not pass on referral information, particularly mobile apps.
  Large numbers of direct sessions can be addressed by using URL tags in links people would use to access a site, for instance in a social
  media campaign.
  
device: |
  [Device category](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3123672?hl=en): 
  Indicates the device categories used to engage with web content: desktop, tablet, or mobile.
