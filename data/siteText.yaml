aboutThisReport: |
  Many USGS Water websites and web applications use Google Analytics (GA) to track and report web traffic. 
  With this report, you can compare traffic across a number of USGS Water web applications and see individual 
  application traffic details. The GA API is used to update data on a daily basis.

disclaimer1: |
  GA algorithms are subject to change without notice and these changes may impact apparent trends in usage. 

  Web applications included in this report have used GA for varying periods of time; therefore retrospective analysis 
  may be limited by the GA history available for any given website or application.

disclaimer2: |  
  [Bot Filtering](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1010249?hl=en) is a function that removes traffic attributed 
  to automated crawlers (not real users) from web traffic tracking and reporting. Until recently bot filtering was used 
  inconsistently across projects included in this report. Bots and spiders may artificially inflate the reported traffic 
  for a website; reported data from low traffic websites without bot filtering enabled should be used with caution.  
  Web service calls (such as a user accessing data through the NWIS API) are not included in this report; only user visits 
  to websites are tracked.

session: |
  [Session](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2731565?hl=en#sessions-and-new-users): 
  A GA session is a group of interactions that users make on a website within a given time frame.
  
visitors: |
  [Visitor, new and returning](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1257084?hl=en): 
  The initial session by a user during any given date range is considered to be an additional session 
  and an additional visitor (new visitor). Any future sessions from the same user during the selected 
  time period are counted as additional sessions, but not as additional visitors (returning visitor).
  
geographical: |
  [Geographical data](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6160484?hl=en): 
  Geographical data are obtained from IP-based locations and is approximate. 

average: |
  [Average time on page](http://help.analyticsedge.com/googleanalytics/misunderstood-metrics-time-on-page-session-duration/): 
  The average amount of time users spend on a website. This number can be biased by users who exit a website without navigating 
  to another one. This number should be interpreted with caution, especially for websites with relatively low traffic. 

traffic: |
  [Traffic source / medium](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6099206?hl=en): 
  These two dimensions are combined into a single variable by GA. Source: the origin of your traffic, such as a search engine 
  (for example, google) or a domain (example.com). Medium: the general category of the source, for example, organic search (organic), 
  cost-per-click paid search (cpc), web referral (referral).
